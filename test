Take a nap
"This is my beloved space, where we spend this special time while your photoshoot.
It’s located on Åmotveien 2 in Heggedal, Norway.

It’s fully prepared for my tiniest guests… and for tired parents
We have a changing table and small kitchen where it’s possible to heat your baby’s food if there’s such need.

Sitting area is warm and cosy. You can comfortable breastfeed your baby on the sofa while I prepare tea or coffee for you :).
Or if you’re tired, you can just take a nap while I take pictures of your little one
If you’re a sweet tooth, you’ll find something for yourself too! Good, calm music is also a must have!
